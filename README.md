# Power-Bi-Financial-dashboard
Financial Dashboard - 
In this dashboard I transformed the data to the required numbers like total country,total revenue,total transaction,average revenue.
I used donut chart to show the Total Revenue by Region vise.
For comparison of total revenue and average revenue by region vise i used line and clustered column chart.
For showing total revnue by store vise i used tree map and similarly I learned Ribbon chart,Area chart and matrix chart.
And also ilearned how to use slicer on dash board.
